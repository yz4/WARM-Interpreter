# WARM-Interpreter
This folder contains my final project for CS237 (Computer Organization)
at Williams College. Partner was Daishiro Nishida '18

In this project, we implemented an interpreter for an assembly language
called WARM (Williams Academic Risc Machine) using another, more limited
assembly language called WIND (Williams Instructional Demonstrator).  
The goal in this project was to minimize both the average number of
native instructions executed per target instruction, as well as the memory
footprint of our program. Our implementation achieved a small average number
of instructions and a relatively small memory footprint.

Detailed explanations of the WIND and WARM architectures can be found in the
'handout' holder, while all the code is in 'wave.s'
